    <h3>Information design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> uses a minimalist approach to information
      design. There is no traditional homepage or menu, but the layout is
      straightforward and easy to follow. As soon as users enter the site, they
      can clearly understand how to begin. The icons are consistent, and the way
      of interacting—similar to drawing—adds to the fun and usability of the
      experience. Although the overall interface is user-friendly, some
      functions lack proper guidance. For example, the environmental indicator
      panel in the top right corner has no prompt or explanation, which makes it
      easy to overlook. As a result, users might miss out on more advanced
      features like adjusting oxygen levels by planting different kinds of
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> also has no written explanations and uses
      an even more minimalist structure. However, its information layout feels
      somewhat disorganized. The page has no clear title or navigation system,
      so first-time users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of the
      site. After clicking any of the three entries, users are taken to a
      separate loading page, which feels unnecessary and repetitive. The size
      and layout of the loading buttons are also inconsistent, which affects the
      overall readability and sense of professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although both websites do not include traditional menus or text
      descriptions, the way they present information is noticeably different.
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> uses a combination of images and icons to help
      users quickly understand the page's functions and how to interact with
      them. The interface delivers information in a clear and direct way. In
      contrast, <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> only presents three abstract
      title links on the homepage, without background context or visual
      guidance. As a result, users may feel confused and unsure of the site's
      purpose during their first visit.
    </p>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <p>
      On the <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> website, the design of each control
      clearly expresses its intended function. Each button is labeled with the
      name of a specific creature, and when clicked, the selected element
      appears right away. This matches user expectations very well. The
      placement of creatures is also very straightforward—the creature appears
      exactly where the user clicks. Users can understand and operate the system
      without the need for any instructions or documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interaction in <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> mainly takes place
      within the instrument interface. Although users can click or drag elements
      to control sounds or visuals, the controls themselves offer no labels or
      hints. As a result, the connection between user actions and system
      responses is not always clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> focuses on clarity in its mapping design,
      allowing users to easily understand the logic of the controls.
      <strong>Intersymmetric</strong>, on the other hand, emphasizes freedom of
      exploration but sacrifices predictability and guidance. This may lead to
      confusion, especially for users who are visiting the site for the first
      time.
    </p>

    <h3>Characterisation</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> uses a consistent pixel art style combined with
      soft color tones. Even though it features a wide range of colors, the
      overall saturation is well controlled, helping to prevent visual fatigue.
      This creates a calm and comfortable interface environment that supports
      long-term observation. The icons, animations, and backgrounds all follow
      the pixel style, maintaining visual consistency and enhancing user
      immersion. The background also changes automatically throughout the day,
      transitioning from morning to evening lighting, which further improves the
      visual experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> has a more abstract and
      minimalist design. The page background is pure white, and the text is
      displayed in colorful gradient fonts. However, the site lacks a strong
      visual hierarchy and guidance. The styles and layouts of the interactive
      elements and loading buttons are inconsistent, which weakens the overall
      unity of the interface design.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> creates a visually comfortable atmosphere with
      rich colors and detailed content. <strong>Intersymmetric</strong>, on the
      other hand, uses a minimalist approach to express its ideas, but it
      appears weaker in terms of visual consistency for the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      On the <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> website, every user action receives
      immediate and clear visual feedback. For example, when clicking to add an
      element, the new creature instantly appears on the page. The feedback
      mechanism is effective and easy to understand from a visual perspective. I
      think that if sound feedback were added on top of this, the overall
      experience of the site would feel even more complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feedback on <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> is mainly sound-based.
      When users interact with the graphical controls, they trigger synth-like
      audio changes. This type of sound feedback is artistic and
      improvisational, which enhances the sensory level of interaction. However,
      due to the lack of a clear mapping between action and response, users may
      find it difficult to tell whether their interaction was successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Orb.Farm</strong> focuses on making the result of each action
      clearly visible, while <strong>Intersymmetric</strong> leans toward
      sound-driven artistic feedback. These two sites represent different
      approaches—functionality versus sensory expression.
